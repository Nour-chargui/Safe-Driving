#Project Title: Safe Driving Vision System

Objective: The main goal of this data science project is to develop a computer vision system capable of detecting whether a driver is adhering to traffic regulations. This contributes to promoting safer driving practices and enhancing road safety.

Topics:
1. Detect and record vehicle license plates.
   Keywords: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Object Detection, Convolutional Neural Network, Object Tracking, Image Processing.

Tools: OpenCV, YOLO.

Input Data: Traffic surveillance video transformed into frames using OpenCV.

Intermediate Data: Extract the project's subject object from frames using object detection tools like YOLO.

2.Data Preprocessing:
- Perform preprocessing operations on images with OpenCV, such as resizing, normalization, etc., to prepare training data.

3.Model Training:
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Train the model to detect seat belts in the images.

4.Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision.
- Make adjustments if necessary.

#This project utilizes advanced techniques and tools in deep learning and computer vision to enhance road safety by detecting and monitoring adherence to traffic rules, particularly focusing on seat belt usage.
